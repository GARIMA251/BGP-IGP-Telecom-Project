# **Implementation and Analysis of BGP Peering and IGP Routing in a Telecom Backbone Network**

## **Project Overview**

This project demonstrates the **implementation and analysis of Border Gateway Protocol (BGP)** and **Interior Gateway Protocol (IGP)** in a **telecom backbone network**. The goal is to model how **BGP** facilitates communication between different **Autonomous Systems (AS)** and how **OSPF** (Open Shortest Path First), a widely used **IGP**, ensures efficient routing within a single AS. By simulating the integration of these protocols, the project provides insight into how data is transferred across telecom infrastructure.

The project aims to solve real-world telecom network challenges by combining both **inter-domain** and **intra-domain** routing in a seamless manner, allowing for optimal communication, fault tolerance, and scalability.

## **Project Components**

### **1. Network Topology and Design**

The network consists of a series of routers, each configured with **BGP** and **OSPF** for routing, and **PCs** to simulate end-user connectivity. The topology is as follows:

- **Router 1** connects to **Router 3** using **BGP** for inter-AS communication.
- **Router 2** connects to **Router 6** also using **BGP** for inter-AS communication.
- **Routers 3, 4, 5, and 6** use **OSPF** to establish routing within their own respective AS.

The network is designed to simulate a **telecom backbone** by connecting routers across different ASes while ensuring internal routing within each AS using OSPF.

### **2. Configured Routing Protocols**

- **BGP (Border Gateway Protocol)**: 
  - **Used for inter-domain communication**, specifically for routing between **different Autonomous Systems (AS)**. This ensures that data can be routed across different networks that are administratively separate but still need to communicate.

- **OSPF (Open Shortest Path First)**: 
  - **Used for intra-domain communication** within a single AS. It ensures efficient and loop-free routing between routers in the same AS.

### **3. Tools and Technologies Used**

- **Cisco Packet Tracer**: The simulation software used to design and test the network topology.
- **Cisco CLI Commands**: Used for configuring BGP, OSPF, and interfaces, as well as for troubleshooting and verifying network status.
- **Ping**: For testing connectivity between devices and visualizing the routing path.
